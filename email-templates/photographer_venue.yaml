We are pleased to offer you a VENUE ACCESS PRESS TAG for the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, to be held January 19 – 29 in Park City, Salt Lake City and Sundance, Utah. This tag provides access to a specific event or venue to which you requested access. The specified event will be outlined on the tag when you pick it up in the Festival Press Office.<br /><br />
Tags must be picked up in person at the Festival Press Office in Festival Headquarters, Ballrooms 1 & 2 of the Park City Marriott (1895 Sidewinder Drive). We strongly recommend you pick up your tag as soon as you arrive in Park City. The Festival Press Office will be open from 12:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 18 for Press Tag pick-up only, and on January 19 – 29 from 8:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m.<br /><br />
The Tags will indicate the time and space in which you are allowed to film or photograph. Tags must be prominently displayed on cameras and the owner of the tag must adhere to the time restrictions indicated. You will receive a zip tie to secure the tag to your gear.<br /><br />
Please note that we will not be mailing printed film guides in advance of the Festival this year. Instead refer to the digital program guide <a href=\"http://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival/program\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival/program</a> to view the official program and to plan your Festival.
