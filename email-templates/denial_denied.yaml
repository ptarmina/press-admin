body: "Dear #{f_name},<br /><br />
Thank you for your interest in covering the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. Due to our desire to keep the Festival as accessible to the public as possible and to maintaining a high level of service for those who attend, we are limited in the number of credentials we can issue to press  and can only accredit a fraction of the journalists who apply. Because of this, we are unable to accommodate your request for press credentials at this yearâ€™s Festival.<br /><br />
If you still wish to attend, information on tickets and ticket packages can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival/get-tickets\">http://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival/get-tickets</a>.<br /><br />
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact <a href=\"mailto:presscoverage@sundance.org\" target=\"_top\">presscoverage@sundance.org</a>.<br /><br />
Thank you again.<br /><br />
Sincerely,<br />
The Sundance Film Festival Press Office"
