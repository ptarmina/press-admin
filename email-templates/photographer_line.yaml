body: "Dear #{f_name},<br /><br />
We are pleased to offer you a ALL PRESS LINES PRESS TAG for the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, to be held January 21 – 31in Park City, Salt Lake City and Sundance, Utah. This tag provides access to film official press lines, filmmaker introductions and post-screening Q&A sessions at Sundance Film Festival theaters on a space available basis.<br /><br />
Tags must be picked up in person at the Festival Press Office in Festival Headquarters, Ballrooms 1 & 2 of the Park City Marriott (1895 Sidewinder Drive). We strongly recommend you pick up your tag as soon as you arrive in Park City. The Festival Press Office will be open from Noon MT – 6:00 pm MT on Wednesday, January 18 for Press Tag pick-up only, and on January 19 – 29 from 8:00 am MT – 6:00 pm MT.<br /><br />
The Tags will indicate the time and space in which they are allowed to film or photograph. Tags must be prominently displayed on cameras and the owner of the tag must adhere to the time restrictions indicated. You will receive a zip tie to secure the tag to your gear. Please note that having the tags does not guarantee a spot on the press line. The Sundance Film Festival press office does not take RSVPs for press lines. Feel free to touch base with each film’s publicist directly to discuss a film’s press line. Please note, a tag does not allow access to stay for a film’s screening. You will need a public ticket if you wish to see a film.<br /><br />
Please note that we will not be mailing printed film guides in advance of the Festival this year. Instead refer to the digital program guide <a href=\"http://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival/program\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival/program</a> to view the official program and to plan your Festival. It is optimized for printing at home if needed.<br /><br />
